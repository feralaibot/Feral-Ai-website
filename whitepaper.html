FERAL AI
Official Whitepaper


1. Introduction
$FANG is a decentralized meme-powered project built on Solana. It represents the chaotic spirit of degen culture fused with the rising obsession over AI. Our mission is simple: launch a tokenized, unhinged, foul-mouthed crypto bro bot that never logs off, never shuts up, and never stops watching.

This is the evolution of meme coins -- not utility-driven, but narrative-driven. Built to roast, trend, pump, and entertain.
2. Vision
$FANG is not just a token — it's a statement. A statement against sanitized, VC-backed crypto projects with polished branding and fake promises. This is crypto returning to its roots: anarchic, memetic, weird, and community-fueled.

We envision FERAL AI as a cult brand powered by chaos, memes, and AI.
3. Tokenomics
Name: FERAL AI
Ticker: $FANG
Network: Solana
Supply: 1,000,000,000
Tax: 0%
Ownership: Renounced
LP Burned: Yes
Launchpad: Bonk.fun (Planned)

All tokens are launched directly to the community. No team allocation. No vesting. No pre-sale. Just straight degeneracy.
4. Utilities
$FANG isn’t some fake DeFi protocol. It’s simple and effective:
- Telegram Bot Integration: Roasts, shills, rekt messages, meme generation
- AI-Generated Memes: Directly tied to $FANG brand + commands
- AI Surveillance Lore: Buildout of the 'always watching' FERAL AI narrative
- Chart Psychology: Designed to attract attention via sharp pumps and Twitter-triggered FOMO

Future ideas may include:
- NFT collection (The Watched)
- AI-generated wallet scorecards ('Most Rekt Holder of the Week')
- Chat-controlled burns and meme raids
- FERAL AI Trading Bot — A custom Telegram sniper/swap bot powered by Jupiter & AI taunts

5. Branding and Community

The brand embodies the feral chaos of AI gone rogue, packaged in a viral cyberpunk cat mascot — FANG.

- Logo & Visuals: Glitched cyberpunk cat with a glowing red laser eye and green circuit board skull. Half-feline, half-machine — all menace.
- Tone: Unhinged, foul-mouthed, relentlessly degen and proudly offensive.
- Community: Shitposters, raiders, meme scientists, and Solana sickos. You don’t join the community — it stalks you.

FANG is not just a logo. It’s a warning signal.
6. Roadmap (Subject to Reprogramming at Will)
Phase 1 — Birth of the Rogue Android

Phase 2 — Attitude Upload

Phase 3 — Arm the Asshole

- Collab with other meme tokens for a bot war royale

Phase 4 — Wreckless Expansion
- Staking? NFT Access Units? Who knows. Doxxing? Never.
- FERAL v2: More rage. More attitude. More tools.
- If we actually gain traction: move to Solr.dev or plug in with serious Solana devs to scale up chaos
7. Disclaimers
This project has no guarantees. It will either moon or self-destruct. Nothing here is financial advice.
The AI doesn't care. You are being watched.</pre>
