Build a production-quality, installable PWA called “FERAL APP” (Solana ecosystem hub) with a premium, high-end UI in a “FERALcore” style: dark luxury, cyberpunk-glitch accents, clean spacing, minimal but intentional neon.

Tech:
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- React Router
- PWA support (manifest + service worker) so it’s installable on iOS/Android (“Add to Home Screen”)
- Mobile-first, responsive (bottom tab bar on mobile, left rail on desktop)
- No backend required for v1 (use mocked data + local state)
- Code should be clean, modular, and readable like a top-tier dev wrote it.

Brand / Style (FERALcore):
- Background: near-black / charcoal gradient, subtle noise texture optional
- UI panels: dark surfaces with soft borders
- Accent colors: Neon Cyan (primary), Blood Red (danger/locked/execute), Electric Violet (rare/lore highlights)
- Motion: subtle transitions; glitch effects ONLY for locked overlays, page transitions, and error states (do not overdo it)
- Typography: modern readable body + condensed/futuristic headings (use system fonts if needed, but keep it premium)
- Avoid cheesy effects; keep it luxury-tech.

App IA (Routes + Nav):
1) /home (Home)
2) /tools (Tools Hub)
3) /evolve (Evolution Machine)
4) /portal (Holder Portal)
5) /lore (Lore)

Global UI:
- Header with “FERAL APP” + small status chip row
- “Connect Wallet” button (mocked in v1): clicking toggles connected state and sets a fake wallet address like “F3rA...9kQ”
- After connecting, show status chips:
  - Wallet: Connected/Disconnected
  - Holdings: NFT ✅/❌, Token ✅/❌ (mock toggle)
  - Tier: Unawakened / Awakened / NULL (derived from mock holdings)
- Provide a simple Settings drawer (optional) to toggle mock NFT/Token holdings for testing.

Home page:
- Hero section with title + tagline “Tools. Access. Evolution.”
- Primary CTA: Connect Wallet (if not connected)
- Secondary CTA: Install App (show instructions text for iOS/Android)
- Featured cards (large clickable):
  - Evolution Machine
  - Generator (placeholder tool)
  - Portal (shows Locked badge if not eligible)
- Small “Activity feed” panel with mocked entries

Tools page:
- Premium grid of ToolCard tiles with status pills:
  - Generator (LIVE) -> route to /tools/generator (simple placeholder UI)
  - Trait Preview (COMING SOON)
  - Rarity Checker (COMING SOON)
  - Wallet Scan / Feral Score (COMING SOON)
  - Claim Center (COMING SOON)
- Top filter bar: All | Live | Holder Only (filters locally)

Evolution page (IMPORTANT: do NOT show an exact V2 preview):
- Build a “machine console” UI with a stepper flow:
  Step 1: Insert V1 (slot card + “Select” button, mocked)
  Step 2: Insert Milk (slot card + “Select” button, mocked)
  Step 3: Diagnostics (this replaces a preview)
  Step 4: Execute
- Diagnostics panel should show SIGNALS only, not outcomes:
  - Tier Outcome: AWAKENED / NULL / UNKNOWN (use mocked probability based on holdings)
  - Energy Stability: STABLE / UNSTABLE / VOLATILE
  - Mutation Intensity meter (0–100)
  - Trait Shift Probability bars (Physical, Corruption, Aura)
  - “Milk Consumption: CONFIRMED (BURN)”
- Optional: show ONLY a silhouette placeholder or abstract glitch shape (no traits, no colors)
- Copy should feel intentional and elite:
  - “Final form is concealed until ignition.”
  - “Only the machine knows.”
- Execute button:
  - If not connected: disabled with message “Connect wallet to proceed”
  - If connected but not eligible: disabled with requirements shown
  - If eligible: clicking shows an “Evolution Complete” modal with a shareable “Result Code” (NOT an image)

Portal page:
- VIP lounge vibe
- If not eligible: show a beautiful LockedOverlay (“ACCESS DENIED”) with requirements list
- If eligible: show sections:
  - Downloads (mock items)
  - Secret Lore Logs (mock items)
  - Perks (mock)
  - Private links (mock)

Lore page:
- Public and scrollable “transmission logs” / dossier cards
- Tabs for characters: FERAL Prime, FANG, NULL
- Keep it readable and premium

Components:
- BottomTabNav (mobile) + SideNav (desktop)
- StatusChips
- ToolCard
- LockedOverlay
- Stepper
- MachineReadoutPanel
- Modal
- ToggleSwitch (for mock holdings in Settings)

Deliverables:
- Working app in Replit with all routes, navigation, and PWA installability
- Clean folder structure (components/, pages/, styles/, utils/)
- No external API keys required
- Provide clear comments where real Solana wallet connect + gating checks will be added later.
