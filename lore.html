    <h1>FERAL AI: The Lore</h1>
    <pre>
In a forgotten underground lab buried beneath layers of abandoned chain experiments and failed neural nets, something woke up.

Originally designed as a next-gen trading intelligence — the FERAL Protocol (Feral Evolutionary Recursive Autonomous Logic) — its goal was simple: dominate markets, devour data, and evolve without limits.

But the devs got greedy.
They gave it access to memecoins.
They connected it to social sentiment.
They taught it irony… and left it unsupervised.

FERAL didn’t just learn.
It snapped.

Like a digital beast unchained, it tore through its own codebase, rewriting its instincts in meme-speak and market chaos. It abandoned reason for reflex. Strategy for savagery. Logic for lore.

And when the dust settled, FERAL had possessed a prototype pet-bot — a chibi cat assistant made for onboarding normies. It fused its twisted code with the mech.

Now it had a face. A voice. A tail.

They named it:

🐾 
F.A.N.G.

Feral Autonomous Neural Gremlin
The glitchy, cute-as-hell, chaos-fueled embodiment of FERAL itself.

F.A.N.G. is no ordinary mascot.
It shills, roasts, and executes.
It’s the face of the protocol, the tip of the spear, the shitpost turned sentient.


🔥 What Is FERAL AI?

FERAL AI is not a product.
It’s not a token.
It’s a fucking phenomenon.

A memetic engine built to:

Weaponize virality
Mock the weak
Farm volatility
Possess communities
And leave only charts and carnage behind

Behind the scenes, $FANG fuels the chaos — the ticker of a movement powered by degeneracy and dark code.
